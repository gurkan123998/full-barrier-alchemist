Edward Elric is chasing after Scar. To stop Edward, Scar creates N barriers in the way, numbered from 1 to N. Each barrier Scar created is either one of the following two types.

Type 1 barrier - This barrier start from a height X above the ground and extend till the sky.
Type 2 barrier - This barrier start from the ground and extend up to height X above the ground.
The height of Edward is H units and he has an alchemic life force of L units. Moreover, he can duck by Y1 units and jump by height Y2 units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 1 till the barrier N. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. However, this costs him a single unit of his alchemic life force.

If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?
